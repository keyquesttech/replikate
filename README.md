This is a custom "Voron V0" modified to increase the bed size, while keeping the Z height the same.

**Why? -** The short answer is because I can and this is my hobby, however there's some factual reasons as to why I did it and why I did it how I did.

**Why even bother if the Z height is the same as a V0?** - Sure, you could simply buy or build one of the official Voron printers if you want a larger device. However, if you already own a V0 or simply wish to print more parts in a single run, this could be for you. Here's a list of reasons to consider:

 - Most of the time to print more parts you need more bed, not height.
 - Splitting parts in to multiple smaller parts is an option if you're desperate for Z volume.

**If I have a V0 can I upgrade? -** Realistically speaking yes, however it's not cheap and most parts are designed to be printed in [SLS](https://3d.jlcpcb.com/).

**What's diferent on this printer compared to the V0? -** Besides the obvious increase in bed size here's a list of upgrades and features:
